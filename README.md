### 🚀 **Projects**

#### 🎥 [IMDB & Box Office Correlation Analysis](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-dynamictitans)
In this project, I analyzed the correlation between **IMDB ratings** and **box office revenue** for movies. Using Python and data visualization tools, I explored trends, identified key factors influencing revenue, and provided actionable insights for the film industry.

#### 🧬 [RNA Language Models for Catalytic Function Prediction](https://github.com/yourusername/rna-language-models) *(Coming Soon!)*
Stay tuned for my upcoming project where I explore **RNA language models** to predict catalytic functions. This project combines my interests in **machine learning** and **biological data**, aiming to contribute to advancements in computational biology. The ultimate goal is to create a model that given a RNA sequence can predict its function.
